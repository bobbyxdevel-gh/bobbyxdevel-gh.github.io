Hi, Iâ€™m **Bobby** â€” a tech enthusiast and system tinkerer who values control, performance, and minimalism.

I enjoy working close to the metal. Whether it's customizing Android at the root level, fine-tuning Arch Linux setups, or building embedded systems from scratch, Iâ€™m drawn to challenges that require understanding how things really work. I prefer tools that are efficient, transparent, and respect the user's control.

## What I Do

- Build and maintain custom Linux environments, often with Arch or minimal distros like DietPi
- Root and mod Android devices to unlock full potential
- Develop hybrid hardware-software projects (e.g. [bobbyx-pi-mobile-router])
- Create static websites using Hugo, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages
- Dive deep into embedded C, Python, and system-level programming

## My Stack & Tools

- **OS:** Arch Linux, DietPi, and sometimes bare-metal installs
- **Editors:** Vim/Neovim, VSCodium, Zed, Emacs (experimenting)
- **Web:** Hugo, Jekyll, GitHub Pages, custom domains
- **Languages:** C, Python, Bash, HTML/CSS, JavaScript (as needed)
- **Other:** Git, tmux, systemd, udev, iptables/nftables, WireGuard

## Projects

- **[bobbyx-pi-mobile-router](https://github.com/bobbyxdevel-gh/bobbyx-pi-mobile-router):** A portable Pi-based VPN/hotspot with a TFT display
- **[bobbyxdevel-gh.github.io](https://bobbyx.de):** My personal homepage â€” minimal, functional, and built with Hugo

Iâ€™m always looking to learn, break things, and build better systems. If you're into low-level control, privacy-focused tooling, or pushing devices beyond their defaults, weâ€™re probably on the same page.
